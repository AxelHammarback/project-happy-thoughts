# Happy Thoughts

This week's project was to dive deeper into React and create a Twitter-esque feed using a public API where all the messages are stored.


## The problem

Had a hard time grasping the main concepts, so spent a lot of time just going through tutorials and the provided video material on useEffect. After that, I tried to de-structure the brief to find out what components I needed, and what I wanted them to do. Couldn't manage to split it up in the way I wanted, so most of the stuff is happening inside App.js. Oh well – back at it next week.


### If I had more time

There's very little validation at the moment. If I had more time, I would have tried to implement the word counter and disabling posting messages if the message is longer than 140 characters (or shorter than 5). Also, I really wanna learn how to animate with React. But we'll get there ✌️
